## 1. Describe the concept of Ingress in Kubernete

In Kubernetes, an Ingress  ek entry point ki tarah act karta hai,  for the traffic jo ki  bahar se aate hai. 

**Functionalities:**

- **Traffic Routing:** Ingress  mei hum rules define karte ha jiske according incoming traffic backend per perticular service ki taraf jate heiin your cluster based on various factors like hostnames, paths, or even headers in the request.
- **Load Balancing:** Yaha par hum traffic ko distribute kar sakte hai  (for distributing the load)  to ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **Name-based Virtual Hosting:** You can configure Ingress to handle multiple virtual hosts on a single IP address
- **HTTPS Termination (Optional):** Ingress can be configured to terminate SSL/TLS connections for incoming HTTPS traffic, jisse humara data aur bhi secure ho jata hai by encryption.

**Benefits of using Ingress:**

- **Simplified Management:** Ingress humko ek centralized approach provide karta hai jisme hum har service ke liye individual load balancer ko configure ko karne wale kaam ko avoid kar sakte hai.
- It provides flexibility, scalability and security

**Implementation:**

- Ingress itself is a Kubernetes API object. You define the desired routing rules in a YAML file and apply it using `kubectl`.
- An Ingress controller, which is a separate pod or deployment, runs in your cluster and translates the Ingress rules into configurations understood by your cloud provider or load balancer. (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller is a popular choice)

## 2. Describe the simple yaml file to create the ingress

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp-example
spec:
  rules:  # Corrected indentation and pluralization
  - host: www.xyz.com
    http:
      paths:
      -
        path: /shop  # Corrected indentation
        pathType: Prefix  # Corrected indentation
        backend:
          service:
            name: nginx-service  # Corrected indentation
            port:
              number: 8080  # Corrected property name ("Lumber" to "number")

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

This code defines an Ingress resource named `simple-webapp-example`. The `spec` section specifies the configuration details:

- **`rules`:** This list defines routing rules for incoming traffic. The current configuration has only one rule.
    - **`host`:** This specifies the hostname that will match this rule. In this case, traffic directed to `www.xyz.com` will be handled by this rule.
    - **`http`:** This section indicates that the rule applies to HTTP traffic.
        - **`paths`:** This list defines path-based routing within the rule. The current configuration routes traffic for the path `/shop` (and any sub-paths starting with `/shop`) to the backend service.
            - **`path`:** The path on which the rule will match incoming requests.
            - **`pathType`:** This specifies how the path should be matched. Here, `Prefix` indicates that any path starting with `/shop` will be matched.
            - **`backend`:** This section defines the backend service to which traffic will be routed.
                - **`service`:** This specifies the name of the service to route traffic to. Here, it's `nginx-service`.
                - **`port`:** This defines the port on the service where traffic will be directed. The corrected version uses `number: 8080` to specify port 8080.

## 4. Describe the concept of deashboard in kubernete

In Kubernetes, the dashboard is a web-based user interface (UI) that provides a centralized view and management capabilities for your Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to:

**Monitor Resources:**

- View the health and status of your deployments, pods, nodes, and other Kubernetes objects.
- Get insights into resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage) of your applications running in containers.
- Monitor events and logs related to your cluster activity.

**Manage Applications:**

- Deploy new applications by creating deployments or replicasets. You can even use YAML manifests for deployment configuration.
- Scale deployments (increase or decrease replicas) to adjust application capacity based on demand.
- View logs from running pods within your deployments.
- Execute commands directly within pods for troubleshooting purposes.

**Explore Cluster Configuration:**

- View details of your cluster configuration, including namespaces, quotas, and resource limits.
- Inspect the configurations of deployments, pods, services, and other Kubernetes objects.

**Basic vs. Advanced Features:**

- The Kubernetes dashboard offers various features, with some geared towards beginners and others targeting more advanced users.
    - **Basic features:** Viewing resource statuses, deployments, logs, and basic pod management are suitable for getting started.
    - **Advanced features:** Inspecting cluster configurations, managing secrets, and advanced pod management require a deeper understanding of Kubernetes concepts.

**Benefits of Using the Dashboard:**

- **Simplified Management:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster, reducing the reliance on command-line tools for basic tasks.
- **Improved Visibility:** Offers an overview of the cluster's health, resource utilization, and application deployments, aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring.
- **Quicker Development Iteration:** Enables rapid deployment and management of containerized applications, streamlining the development process.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Security:** The Kubernetes dashboard is not intended for production environments by default due to potential security vulnerabilities. If used, proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to restrict access. Consider alternative solutions for production deployments with stricter security requirements.
- **Limited Functionality:** While the dashboard offers valuable functionalities, it's not a replacement for the full suite of Kubernetes command-line tools (kubectl) or more advanced management platforms.

In summary, the Kubernetes dashboard is a helpful tool for beginners and experienced users alike to interact with their Kubernetes clusters visually. It streamlines basic management tasks, provides insights into cluster health, and expedites development workflows. However, keep in mind its security limitations and consider alternative solutions for production deployments with stricter security needs**.**

## 5.Give Step by Step to create dashboard in Kubernete

```yaml
# Add the Kubernetes Dashboard repository:

helm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/

#  Deploy the Kubernetes Dashboard:

helm upgrade --install kubernetes-dashboard kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard --create-namespace --namespace kubernetes-dashboard

# serach your dashboard service - kubernetes-dashboard-kong-proxy

# Change the service type from cluster ip to nodeport

kubectl get service -n kubernetes-dashboard

# Open the Dashboard UI in your browser:

http://<master-node-IP>:<NodePort> # Well when you typed 2nd command then all the instruction automatically might came

# Genrate the  service account 

kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard-admin -n kubernetes-dashboard

# create the cluster role binding

kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-rolebinding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kubernetes-dashboard:dashboard-admin

# create the token (I failed at this step)

kubectl create token dashboard-admin -n kubernetes-dashoboard
